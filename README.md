## About

This project uses the TR2N font http://randombell.com/

The source code is for CircuitPython to run on the Raspberry Pi Pico or Pi Pico W. There is code to initialize the time over WIFI or adjust the hours and minutes using buttons. Either can be disabled relatively easily by removing or commenting imports and code out in the tron.py file. WIFI requires CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1 or later. The code requires an AD7302 DAC, but could use an R-2R or other type of DAC by replacing the ad7302.py file.

PIO is used to output data in parallel to the AD7302. Each 32 bits of data contains 8-bit x and y values and an 8-bit relative brightness. Frame rates tend to be around 80-90fps, but fall as low as 20fps during the zoom transition animation. A looping background write is used to allow the screen to refresh at a high rate regardless of the frame rate. Data is stored in ulap.numpy arrays to allow quick updates for the animations.

Data for drawing the time characters is stored in char_data.txt and is loaded during initialization. The data is stored as base64 x and y value with an end of line between each character. The data was generated by creating a image of each character and then using Inkscape to convert the images to SVG. SVG was then parsed using the svg.path python library.
